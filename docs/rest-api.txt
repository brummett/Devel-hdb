to functions.

The header X-Stack-Serial will be the same as the 'serial' value for this
frame.  The header X-Stack-Line will be the same as the 'line' value
for this frame.

The caller may request the HEAD to retrieve the header and avoid
re-getting data it already knows.

    is_require: boolean - true if the frame is created by a "require" or "use"
                            statement

be undef, useful to avoid serializing potentially deep data structures passed
to the function.
